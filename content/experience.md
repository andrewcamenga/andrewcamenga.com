           The Adams Center Seventh Day Baptist Church called an ordination council to examine my qualification and readiness to be recognized as a minister of the gospel.

            **Note:** Before 2015, Accreditation, like ordiantion, was granted once. In 2015, the Conference began to grant Accreditation for 5 year terms and created a renewal process for ascertaining that the individual still desires accreditation and still meets the necessary criteria.
