My first attempt at javascript footnotes is live. It has quite a bit further to go.

I used information from [hugo footnotes popup](https://www.vojtech.net/posts/hugo-footnotes-popup/) and javascript documentation to pull this together. Time will tell how much more I need to tweak the script.

The basic style was insipired by [Five Thirty Eight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/)'s footnote displays.
