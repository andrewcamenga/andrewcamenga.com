A couple of weeks ago, I discovered that the android version of Garmin Connect is no longer including a view of my step count that I had chosen to use as my primary metric{{ fn }}My chosen metric is steps per month. That view allows me quickly to see whether I'm on target to average 10,000 steps a day.{{ /fn}}. Instead they now provide a view by weeks—and, worse, that view changes every day!{{ fn }}As in, the weeks view always counts backward from today. So, you can see what you did in the last six days, and then the seven days before that, and then the seven days before that. 

I can understand the logic of the choice: you are always comparing to a comparable timeframe. However, I'm much more geared to think about life by organizing it in weeks, months, and years with fixed beginnings.

When I asked customer support, they used the passive voice to describe the change (it was something that happened to them) and said it would likely be changed in a future update. They did point out that their website continues to offer the view.{{ /fn }}

This was quite frustrating. I did a little digging, discovered that someone had already created a python module that will interface with Garmin's servers and extract, among other things, historical steps data.

So, with a little bit of work, I've written a program that automatically downloads the data and then creates a webpage with the data I want to see. It was a fun little project which occupied a few evenings.
