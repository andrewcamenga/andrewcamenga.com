I love the passion, wit, and eloquence that emerge when thoughful, reasonable people strive to convince others that their perception of the world is right and that they know the best action to take in this moment.

My delight grows when I observe two thoughtful, reasonable people engage each other in persuasive conversation. They listen with care to each other. They restate what they've heard—often in words that bring additional clarity to the conversation. They deeply consider the other's position.

I take delight because I love to see and hear well-crafted english—and conversations in this mode often generate a treasure chest of tightly tuned phrases.

And, I take delight because I believe in truth, and I see in these conversations a pursuit of truth—each person willing to consider and reconsider the best way to look at the world. 

I've seen times when vast differences become minor as people engage in this kind of discussion. I've seen people persuaded to look at the world in a new way. I've seen a person's world-view crumble as a different world-view rose to become a new foundation.

Yet, much more often, the participants don't change—at least not much. They remain in disagreement. Even when portions of their personal perspectives are swayed, each one remains convinced that the other is standing in the wrong spot.

Careful presentation of ideas and deliberate, meaning-filled interaction in search of truth does not always bring people to the same conclusions.

I don't like that reality. 

I'd much rather have a reality where the guaranteed result of careful, reasoned conversation is agreement.

But, whether by necessity or not, attempts to find or craft agreement often fail.

Why?

There are all sorts of reasons: Because we don't know everything. Because our expereinces are different. Because we emote in different ways—and emoting is part of thinking. Because we are not in charge. Because we can not make change happen. Because our most basic values diverge.

Sometimes the gulf between two people just can't be bridged.

When there are no practical consequences, just note the tension and let things ride.

But, when there are practical consequences, just noting the tension is not enough. A decision about what to how to interact with the world must be made.



what is left is choosing a place to stand.

How you choose well a place to stand is something I continue to ponder. Two phrases come immediately to mind each time I contemplate this topic. The first comes from Romans 14:5 when the author is talking about disputed matters. Here, he calls out 

> Let each one be fully convinced in his own mind.

I've not been able to source the second phrase, but I've heard it most often in this form

> [You should have] strong convictions, weakly held.

When all is said and done, both statements point to the value of knowing where you stand and why you stand there. When choices matter and you will be called on to act, you need to be able to act. Standing in the middle ground
