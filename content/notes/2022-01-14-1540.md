Python continues to be a joy for scripting; shaving time off repetitive tasks and allowing for much more 
standard output. My primary project last year focused on setting up and printing a church calendar.

I'm grateful for the people who have created libraries like parsimonious, Pillow, PyYAML, and reportlab. Those 
tools greatly simplified the task at hand.
