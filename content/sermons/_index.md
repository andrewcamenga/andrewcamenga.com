<p class="subtitle is-size-5 is-italic">Selected content{{< fn >}}*From 1995 to 2021, I typically preached from  a minimal outline 
(5 or fewer sentences) with handwritten annotation as my guide for preaching.
None of those notes were fit for sharing—they were designed to capture the 
big idea, the flow of thought needed to get there, and just enough of my 
preparation to keep track when standing in front of people.*

*I've just begun (April 2021) to rework my sermon creation process. One of my goals
in the process is to create a document for each sermon that captures the purpose
in a shareble form. If that works, the documents will be shared here.*

*For now, I share the notes from a sermon prepared for the Seventh Day Baptist 
General Conference sessions in 2014 along with a recording of the message.*{{< /fn >}}. Reformated for reading.</p>
